# TiKV NixOS Flake
- This is a flake that provides the TiKV server and placement driver binaries
for consumption in NixOS

- Placment driver not implemented because I need to sleep

## Credits

- [Guide](https://blog.sekun.net/posts/packaging-prebuilt-binaries-with-nix/) for packaging binaries with flakes
